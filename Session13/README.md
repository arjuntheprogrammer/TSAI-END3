# TSAI Assignment

## Session 13 - AWS Sagemaker

ASSIGNMENT

1. Go through this notebook (Links to an external site.), change the dataset (to anything other than "Amazon Reviews Polarity Dataset").
   - <https://github.com/aws-samples/finetune-deploy-bert-with-amazon-sagemaker-for-hugging-face/blob/main/finetune-distilbert.ipynb>
2. Record the whole step using any video capturing software (like OBS).
3. Upload the video on youtube (you can make it unlisted, but allow for embedding)
4. Share the link to your YouTube video, and the GitHub link where I can see the code you used for training (move the notebook with logs from Amazon to Github)

## What is AWS Sagemaker?

- Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale.
- Amazon SageMaker includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models.

Build

- Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to build ML models and get them ready for training by providing everything you need to quickly connect to your training data, and to select and optimize the best algorithm and framework for your application.

Train

- You can begin training your model with a single click in the Amazon SageMaker console. Amazon SageMaker manages all of the underlying infrastructure for you and can easily scale to train models at petabyte scale.

Deploy

- Once your model is trained and tuned, Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to deploy in production so you can start running generating predictions on new data (a process called inference).

Amazon SageMaker takes away the heavy lifting of machine learning, so you can build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and easily.
